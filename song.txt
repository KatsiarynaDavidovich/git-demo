But I'm burning, burning
Cause you set my soul on fire
Girl, I don't know what i'll do
Cause I'm burning, I'm burning
I am burning with desire
Yes, I'm burning; and it's all because of you
Because of you

We can't be together
Iâ€™m not that kind of a guy
I'll be gone and lost forever
And you won't know why
